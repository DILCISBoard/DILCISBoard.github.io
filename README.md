DILCIS Board Git & GitHub Policy
================================

The DILCIS Board use [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
as a version and change control system for specifications and software. These documents
describe the board's conventions for Git branch usage and a guide for contributors.
They don't provide help for Git, a command line version control tool, or
GitHub, a source code hosting platform based on Git.

Reader's wanting help on Git should start with the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc/).
Likewise GitHub provide a extensive documentation on [their help pages](https://help.github.com/).
There are numerous third party tutorials for Git and GitHub but personal preference
is a strong factor as to what may prove most useful for you. Google is your friend
here. We do provide a list of getting started resources later in this document.
